## The Impact of COVID-19 on Canadian Crime Rates (Python)

Objective: Analyze the impacts of the Coronavirus outbreak on Canadian Crime in 2020 and future
trajectories.

Introduction: In this report, I review and analyze data surrounding Canadian crime in 2020 and
cross-examine it with SARS-CoV-2 data sources. In doing this, I was looking for any existing
relationships and to use this to predict future outcomes in crime related to the novel
Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). The future outcome I was looking to predict specifically is the trajectory of crime or crimes depending on a rise or fall of Coronavirus cases in Canada. This may include the
possible release of a vaccine in early 2021.

Data Source: I analyzed data that surrounds Canadian crime for 2020 and cross-examine it with SARS-CoV-2 data sources. I used data sources from StatsCan, andOntario Statistics to ensure reliability. We used this data to predict the trajectory of crime or crimes depending on the rise orfall of Coronavirus cases. I am looking for a correlational relationship between the two factors and to better understand the impacts of the Coronavirus outbreak. I chose this dataset as COVID has impacted everyone ºs lives and we were curious tofind out how much of an effect it had on the socio-economic situation in the country.

Hypothesis: With lockdowns going into effect, it is easy to say it may lead to a decrease in crime due to
a decrease in opportunity. However, with the lockdown comes financial hardship. The gap
between the wealthy and poor is growing, which may lead to an increase in crime as the
needs of the people are not being met.

Initial Assumptions and Notes:
- With the data I was using, I did not incorporate outside factors that may be affecting crime. This may lead to a bias in the analysis, certainly creating a weakness.
- I am assuming a causational relationship initially. This may prove not to be true, or if it is true it may not be properly represented in the analysis outcome.
- Results may differ based on how I group and organize the initial data.
- Over the past few years, according to StatsCan , crime in Canada has been in decline over the past two decades. This points to the fact that outside factors may have a larger impact on the data than thought. A causal-relationship will be difficult to establish.
